# Tallybook
Tallybook is an app to keep track of things you do every day.

Built with
- SwiftUI on iOS,
- Typescript, React and Chakra UI on web,
- Firebase backend.

Tallybook has been a great project for me to learn new technologies---I've learned a lot since starting the project, and there are definitely things I'd do differently now.
